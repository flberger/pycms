Documentation for pycms
=======================

pycms is a web content management system based on CherryPy.

Import
------

To use the pycms API, first import the pycms modules.

    >>> import pycms
    >>> import pycms.create
    >>> import pycms.edit
    >>> import pycms.serve
    >>>


Initialising files and directories for a new instance
-----------------------------------------------------

pycms needs a working environment to store the CMS contents in.

This is an ordinary directory, with a subdirectory for templates.

For a new pycms instance, this working environment must be created
before pycms can be used. Otherwise an exception will be raised when
trying to run pycms.

    >>> pycms.serve.serve("pycmsroot", test = True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: Working environment directory 'pycmsroot' not found. Did you run pycms.envinit("pycmsroot")?
    >>>

The 'test' flag will terminate pycms after a short while, for
automated testing.

The envinit() function will take care of creating the
environment.

    >>> pycms.envinit("pycmsroot")
    >>>

There now is a basic environment to work with. Let's take a look:

    >>> import glob
    >>> files = glob.glob("pycmsroot/*")
    >>> files.sort()
    >>> files
    ['pycmsroot/_templates', 'pycmsroot/_uri_template_map.json', 'pycmsroot/index.html']
    >>> glob.glob("pycmsroot/_templates/*")
    ['pycmsroot/_templates/index_template.html']
    >>>


Adding templates
----------------

pycms templates are simple HTML files with placeholder lines.

To add a template, drop it into the '_templates' folder.

    >>> with open("pycmsroot/_templates/new_template.html", "wt") as templatefile:
    ...     templatefile.write('<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<meta charset="utf-8"/>\n<head>\n    <title>\n        TITLE\n    </title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    CONTENT\n</body>\n</html>')
    ...
    135
    >>> files = glob.glob("pycmsroot/_templates/*")
    >>> files.sort()
    >>> files
    ['pycmsroot/_templates/index_template.html', 'pycmsroot/_templates/new_template.html']
    >>>


Creating pages based on templates
---------------------------------

pycms pages are tied to an URI and based on a template. To create a
new page, all of these must be given, along with the environment.

    >>> pycms.create.page("pycmsroot", "/test", "new_template.html")
    >>>

Any trailing URI slash will be stripped before creating the page.
"/test/" and "/test" refer to the same object, though.

    >>> pycms.create.page("pycmsroot", "/test/", "new_template.html")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: URI "/test/" can not be created because it already exists.
    >>>

pycms uses the traditional index page convention to represent contents
on disk. The command will create a new directory and HTML file in the
working environment.

    >>> glob.glob("pycmsroot/test/*")
    ['pycmsroot/test/index.html']
    >>> with open("pycmsroot/test/index.html") as f:
    ...     print(f.read())
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <head>
        <title>
            TITLE
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        CONTENT
    </body>
    </html>
    >>>

It also registers the URI in the template-URI map.

    >>> with open("pycmsroot/_uri_template_map.json") as f:
    ...     print(f.read())
    {"/": "index_template.html", "/test": "new_template.html"}
    >>>


Editing page content
--------------------

You can edit page content in the pycms working environment straight
away with your favourite HTML editor.

pycms expects that you only change the placeholder elements of the
respective page template. Anything concerning the templates will
likely affect other pages as well, so you are expected to change
the template in that case -- see the next section for this.

    >>> with open("pycmsroot/test/index.html", "rt") as f:
    ...    html = f.read()
    ...
    >>> html = html.replace("TITLE", "My first pycms page")
    >>> html = html.replace("CONTENT", '<h1>My fist pycms page</h1>\n<p>This is my first pycms page.</p>')
    >>> with open("pycmsroot/test/index.html", "wt") as f:
    ...     f.write(html)
    ...
    205
    >>> with open("pycmsroot/test/index.html") as f:
    ...     print(f.read())
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <head>
        <title>
            My first pycms page
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My fist pycms page</h1>
    <p>This is my first pycms page.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    >>>


Editing templates and applying changes
--------------------------------------

pycms templates make it very convenient to change the style, layout
and repeating content on several pages.

pycms has to be able to track the changes you are about to make to
a template. So you first have to signal that you are going to edit
it.

    >>> pycms.edit.template("pycmsroot", "new_template.html")
    >>>

This will creat a backup of the current template, with the suffix
'.old' added.

    >>> files = glob.glob("pycmsroot/_templates/*")
    >>> files.sort()
    >>> files
    ['pycmsroot/_templates/index_template.html', 'pycmsroot/_templates/new_template.html', 'pycmsroot/_templates/new_template.html.old']
    >>>

You can now go ahead and edit the original template.

    >>> with open("pycmsroot/_templates/new_template.html", "wt") as templatefile:
    ...     templatefile.write('<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<meta charset="utf-8"/>\n<head>\n    <title>\n        TITLE\n    </title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<hr>\n    CONTENT\n<hr>\n</body>\n</html>')
    ...
    145

After that, notify pycms that you are done updating the template. This
will apply pending changes to all pages using the template, and delete
any preceding versions of the template.

    >>> pycms.edit.update("pycmsroot")
    >>> with open("pycmsroot/test/index.html") as f:
    ...     print(f.read())
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <head>
        <title>
            My first pycms page
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <hr>
        <h1>My fist pycms page</h1>
    <p>This is my first pycms page.</p>
    <hr>
    </body>
    </html>
    >>> files = glob.glob("pycmsroot/_templates/*")
    >>> files.sort()
    >>> files
    ['pycmsroot/_templates/index_template.html', 'pycmsroot/_templates/new_template.html']
    >>>
    

Running the pycms web server
----------------------------

Once there is a working environment, pycms can serve content from it.

The serve() function runs an HTTP server.

    NOTE: Deactivated
    pycms.serve.serve("pycmsroot", test = True)


pycms data representation
-------------------------

When preparing to serve, pymcs parses the working environment and
creates an internal data structure. This is done by the
pycms.envparse() function. This function expects the path to the
working enviromnemt and a pycms.CMS instance as input. For
demonstration purposes, we will use a dummy object here, bypassing
pycms.CMS.__init__().

    >>> class DummyCMS:
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> dummy_cms = DummyCMS()
    >>> dummy_cms.__dict__["__class__"] = pycms.serve.CMS
    >>> pycms.serve.envparse("pycmsroot", dummy_cms)
    >>>

The CMS instance will be populated by the parsing results. In this
case, only the single root page is created, which can be obtained by
calling the CMS instance as a method. This yields the default page
created by pycms.envinit() above.

    >>> dummy_cms()
    '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<meta charset="utf-8"/>\n<head>\n    <title>\npycms Instance Index\n    </title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>pycms Instance Index</h1>\n    <p>Welcome to your pycms instance.</p>\n</body>\n</html>'
    >>>


Deleting a pycms environment
----------------------------

To do this, simply delete the project folder.

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree("pycmsroot")
    >>>


Command line interface
----------------------

To make pycms serve content over an HTTP socket, issue the command

    python pycms.py htmlroot

on the command line. `htmlroot` is a directory containing the data to serve
from and to save to. If written as above, pycms assumes it to be a local
subdirectory. You can also give full qualified paths as `/home/user/htmlroot`
or `C:\htmlroot\`, depending on your operatings system.


Helper Classes and Methods
--------------------------

pycms contains various helpers under the hood to perform its work.


### LineReplacement

The LineReplacement class is being used to compute differences between
templates and actual pages. It utilises knowledge about how pycms
templates work.

    >>> source = """<html>
    ... <head><title>Test Template</title></head>
    ... <body>
    ... REPLACE_THIS
    ... </body>
    ... </html>"""
    >>> result = """<html>
    ... <head><title>Test Template</title></head>
    ... <body>
    ...     <div>
    ...         <p>Replaced!</p>
    ...     </div>
    ... </body>
    ... </html>"""
    >>> lp = pycms.edit.LineReplacement(source, result)
    >>> lp.replacements
    {'REPLACE_THIS': '<div>\n        <p>Replaced!</p>\n    </div>'}
    >>>

It also has a method to apply the found replacements to new strings.

    >>> original = """<html>
    ... <head><title>Another Template</title></head>
    ... <body>
    ...   <div>
    ... REPLACE_THIS
    ...   </div>
    ... </body>
    ... </html>"""
    >>> lp.replace(original)
    '<html>\n<head><title>Another Template</title></head>\n<body>\n  <div>\n<div>\n        <p>Replaced!</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>'
    >>>
