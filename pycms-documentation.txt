Documentation for pycms
=======================

pycms is a web content management system based on CherryPy.

Running the pycms Web Server
----------------------------

To make pycms serve content over an HTTP socket, issue the command

    python pycms.py htmlroot

on the command line. `htmlroot` is a directory containing the data to serve
from and to save to. If written as above, pycms assumes it to be a local
subdirectory. You can also give full qualified paths as `/home/user/htmlroot`
or `C:\htmlroot\`, depending on your operatings system.

You can do the same from a Python environment:

    >>> import pycms
    >>> pycms.serve("htmlroot")
    >>>
